          Hi! I am currently an undergraduate junior studying CS @ UC Riverside. My passion for programming began in middle school, when I wanted to learn how to create games. I enjoy tackling algorithms and building software that has impact towards other people. I am dedicated to building my skills to pursue a career in software engineering so that I can apply my passion for programming and innovation to real-world problems.
